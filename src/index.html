                    <h5>Full Stack Web Developer</h5>
                    <p>I'm Andy Reyes, welcome! Some good stuff about me, I was born and raised in NYC, I absolutely love to travel, meeting new people from all over the world and to be able to experience their culture is incredible for me. I love to draw, play video games, and read books at my lesuire time (as well as love to code, ever since I discovered it.). </p>
                    <!--  Maybe should add this but might be too long ???? =====> I came across Web development through a passion for computer technology, so I found out about this great coding school and decided to take a leap of faith and it has changed my life for the better. I believe I have found my calling in web development. -->
