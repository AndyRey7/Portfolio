Some good stuff about me, I was born and raised in NYC, I absolutely love to travel, meeting new people from all over the world and to be able to experience their culture is incredible for me. I love to draw, play video games, and read books at my lesuire time (as well as love to code, ever since I discovered it.). </p>\n                    <!--  Maybe should add this but might be too long ???? =====> I came across Web development through a passion for computer technology, so I found out about this great coding school and decided to take a leap of faith and it has changed my life for the better. I believe I have found my calling in web development. -->\n                    <div class=\"primary-btn\">Portfolio</div>\n                    <div class=\"ghost-btn\">Resume</div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\n\n\n\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"decff47a04c6180b11cdfaeccca15b6a","cacheData":{}}
